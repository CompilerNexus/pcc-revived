============================

This Git repo is a simple mirror of the CVS repositories for the PCC
Revived project (but without the 'CVS' directories).

This project is a revival of the venerable Unix Portable C Compiler. It
adds C 99 and general GCC compatbility with code generators for i386
and x86_64 among others. The home page is:

	http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/

For installing, you have to first build and install the pcc-libs,
and then build and install pcc. The usual configure && make incantation
is used.  For instructions using CVS, see:

	http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/supported-platforms/

I am creating this Git repo so that I can access the code via HTTP(S)
from behind the corporate firewall at my work. There are no other
motives.
